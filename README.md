When you try to show a file this makes following the mailcap rules.

The idea is to have an valid yaml document within a `⊥` and `⊤` delimiters, is not relevant the content out of them, then you can edit the document with your editor following the yaml rules inside the delimiters or write without rules outside them.

### TOTP support

In order to read time based OTPs you need install **pyotp** (`sudo pip instal pyotp`) and the script will try to read the base32 secret from any field named **otp** in your passx document.

#### Example

```
Add a field called otp to store
        i7@i7-desktop ~ » pass append Bank/One otp
        write the vaue for `otp`: BASE32SECRET3232

Show current TOTP
        i7@i7-desktop ~ » pass show Bank/One otp
        456123

Show existing document
        i7@i7-desktop ~ » pass show Bank/One
        123456
        ⊥
        cvv: 123
        number: 123456789
        otp: BASE32SECRET3232
        ⊤

Show current TOTP
        i7@i7-desktop ~ » pass show Bank/One otp
        789456
```

### Installation

You need to have installed `pass` (`sudo apt-get install pass` in **Ubuntu/Debian**)

```
mkdir -p ~/opt/passx
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/individuo7/passx/master/pass -P ~/opt/passx
chmod +x ~/opt/passx/pass
```

After that you need add it in your `~/.profile`

```export PATH="$HOME/opt/passx:$PATH"```

Then do `source ~/.profile` and try `pass help` to check the changes.
